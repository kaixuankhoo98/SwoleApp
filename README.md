# SwoleApp
Backend is written in Go, using a JWT auth, Gin, and GORM. You can find the repo for that in the [backend repository](https://github.com/kaixuankhoo98/go-jwt).

## Progress
Backend is functional and working with my locally hosted PostgreSQL server!

Future plans to dockerize BE and FE separately
